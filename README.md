👋 Hi, I'm Arman Nasrollahi
Backend Developer | .NET Enthusiast | Security Advocate | Real-Time Systems Architect
Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a passionate backend developer specializing in building scalable, secure, and high-performance applications using C#, .NET, and modern technologies. I love diving into system design, security algorithms, and real-time solutions, all while keeping my code clean and maintainable. When I'm not coding, you might find me exploring isekai manhwa or experimenting with new tech stacks.

🔍 What I'm About

🔭 Currently working on:  

FileSync API: A secure, cloud-based file management system with real-time synchronization using SignalR.  
AuthGuard: A robust authentication system leveraging JWT, OAuth, and cryptographic algorithms (AES, RSA).  
Microservices Playground: A Dockerized .NET microservices architecture with MongoDB and SQL Server.


🌱 Currently learning:  

Advanced DevOps (Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions).  
gRPC for high-performance APIs.  
Advanced cryptography (Elliptic Curve Cryptography, Post-Quantum Cryptography).


💬 Ask me about:  

ASP.NET Core, RESTful API design, and GraphQL.  
MongoDB schema design and performance optimization.  
Real-time communication with SignalR.  
Secure coding practices and cryptographic algorithms (AES, DES, Diffie-Hellman).
